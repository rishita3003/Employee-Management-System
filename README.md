# Backend Overview

The backend of the Employee Management System is built with Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust API for the frontend React application. It interacts with a MySQL database to manage employee data, authentication, and other functionalities essential to the system. Below are key components of the backend:

# Core Dependencies
  
 * ***Express.js:*** Utilized for creating the server and handling API requests.
 * ***MySQL2:*** Facilitates connection and interaction with the MySQL database.
 * ***BCrypt:*** Manages password hashing for secure storage and verification.
 * ***CORS:*** Configured to allow requests from the frontend domain.
 * ***Express-session:*** Manages user sessions for authentication and state management.

# Key Features

* **Authentication**
  
  * ***User Login:*** Validates user credentials and establishes a session. Utilizes BCrypt for password comparison.
  * ***User Registration:*** Supports registering new users (admin registration demonstrated) with hashed passwords stored in the database.

* **Employee Management**
    * ***Employee Registration:*** Facilitates registering new employees, including details like department, role, and project assignments. Checks for existing roles, departments, and project IDs to ensure data integrity.
    * ***Fetching Employee Info:*** Provides endpoints to fetch detailed information about employees, including department and role names, and associated projects.

* **Project Management**
    * ***Manager and Projects Info:*** Endpoints to fetch manager-specific information and the projects they're overseeing, leveraging session data for authentication and personalized content delivery.

* **Attendance and Leave Management**
    * ***Attendance Recording:*** Implements endpoints to record employee attendance entries and exits. Also, allows applying for leaves and managing leave requests with approval/rejection functionality.

* **Payment Management**
Records the payment details after confirming the correct payment ID in the backend.

# Database Connection
Establishes a connection to the MySQL database with configuration details (host, user, password, database).

# Running the Server
The server listens on a specified port (default is 3002) and logs a message when successfully running.


This backend setup ensures that all operations related to employee management, from authentication to project assignments and leave management, are handled efficiently. It lays the foundation for a scalable and secure application capable of supporting various HR functionalities.

For more detailed documentation on the API endpoints and their usage, refer to the in-code comments and Express.js routing setup within the server.js file.


# Database Schema Overview
